# Moon Club: working notes

Native SwiftUI (iOS 17+, iPhone + iPad) kids app; the native twin of mutaafaziz.com/metaphases/kids. Read README.md and docs/ARCHITECTURE.md first. Same kids rules as metaphases AGENTS.md: pretend money only, nothing about the child leaves the device, no ads/analytics/SDKs, no links out except behind the parental gate (GrownUps.swift only — `scripts/check-rules.sh`), Luna = free kid-safe brain with no key, a grown-up voice key only ever speaks app copy or Luna's answer, reading grade ≤ 5, never advice.

## Commands
`make up` (idempotent: xcodegen + Metal toolchain check + rules + core tests + app tests + sims), `make test`, `make shots`, `make device`, `make testflight`, `make content`.

## Environment nuances (found the hard way)
- **XcodeGen** generates `MoonClub.xcodeproj` (gitignored); edit `project.yml`, never the project.
- **Xcode 27.1 ships without the Metal toolchain**: the first build fails with "cannot execute tool 'metal' due to missing Metal Toolchain". `xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain` (≈840 MB, once). `make gen` does it.
- **Simulators**: this Mac's iOS 17/18 runtimes have iPhone 15 / iPad M4 names, but the Xcode 27.1 SDK only targets iOS 26.5+ sims (iPhone 17, iPad Pro 11-inch (M5)…). Names are duplicated across runtimes, so scripts accept `PHONE_ID`/`PAD_ID`.
- **A fresh iOS 27.1 iPad image can hang on `simctl launch`** (install took 50 s, launch never returned). The iOS 27.0 iPad Pro 11-inch (M5) works; `scripts/shots.sh` wraps every simctl call in a timeout.
- Core package is Swift 6 tools with Swift 5 language mode; use `lock.withLock {}` (plain `lock()` is an error from async contexts in Swift 6 mode).
- `ProcessInfo` launch args drive demo mode for screenshots (`-demo -tab … -quest … -lesson …`).
- The kids content JSON must also be copied into `Packages/MoonClubCore/Tests/MoonClubCoreTests/Resources/` (sync-content does both).
